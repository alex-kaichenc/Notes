_General argument against religion_

In order for this to be true, there must be an inalienable part, aspect, a work of this institution, that makes it crutial for our collective economic, social, and moral progress, that makes it crucial for us to thrive, in all sense of the word, as a society.

The word religion encompasses a number of ideas, including the belief and worship of a supernatural being. We all know that religion emcompasses more than these, including the institution, and cultral practices, surrounding these beliefs. It is these institutions and practices that we can't thrive without, rather than necessarily the belief or the things itself. Let me also clarify that it is not so enough to prove that religion stops us from florishing, or that it is ambivalent; just that it is not a necessary condition for the continuing achievement of our collective goals. 

With these in mind, and with the limited time available to me, I am going to focus on two reasons in support of the opposition.

1. The religions hinder intellectual progress due to its traditional doctrine
2. it extends the persecution of group throughtout the globe, by restricting us to an outdated set of values, and code of morality.

## Proposition ([MG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DldKPf5QBn4))

_The Inherent Goodwill of Religious Beliefs_

Summary:

1. In this debate we should not exchange bad examples, because in these examples, both religious and Atheist society fall short to the standard of a good society.
2. Religions lead us to help each other in difficult circumstances. Religions lead us to appreciate, and appreciation leads us to help each other. Emperically, donations are larger and more frequent among those with religion than atheists. Helping other is important for us to thrive in difficult circumstances, which is frequent in history and the forseable future.
3. Religions lead us to help each other in easy circumstances. The notion of haven is not a reward to doing good, but a place for good people to live forever. It leads us to do good things and become easier to do good things in future.
4. Strongest argument for religion is science, because religions explained scientific discovery.

The speech:

What could a thriving society be like? Well, it would care for its member, love each other, grow understanding of the world, and extends human knowledge, tolerant to different beliefs. 

By that criterion, as many of the speakers pointed out, most religious society have fallen short. But what non of the speakers seems to have mentioned, is that in last centry, at least three enormous society has been anti-religion, persecuted religion in a very big way. Hitler's Germany, Starlin's Russia, Mao's China. And remember the first atheism country in the world was Albania, Communist Albania. They achieved this by knocking out churches, killing out belivers. And they achieve the same as those religous societies. So I don't think that on this score ("score of good society") we ought to be exchanging bad examples. They all fallen short.

Human beings are a mixture of good and bad, there are good aspect of our characters, which have nothing to do with beliefs. There are bad characters too. [...] Athesit society can probably do all right, as long as they take care of the problems. But bad time will come to our society before too long. Climate change, aging society, etc.. In that situation, the atheist will have problems. The atheist will afraid. Of course, they do a bit. But after what he says, I only got one life, I came here by chance, I don't owe anything to anybody, why shouldn't I have a good time? That's a very reasonable reaction in times of hard. But what we really need in times of hard is not people just do the right thing in a whole. We need hero, we need people who do a lot more than they are oblidge to. Give up their life for a good cause, for others in a just war; give up their prospect of family and home, to help people in distant country. It is only when you got that sort of people around, and in big number, society really gets to thrive. Because only then are people going to care for other in difficulty. \[POI\] (An example of some atheist donated large portion of their income) A survey in America investigated who give money to charity. They found that those who donate lots of money and large shares of their income to charity, are far greater amoung religious belivers than among atheists (about 1/3 of the donation of religious belivers). People are moved by their religion. One statistic commented was that 71% of people said they gave to charity cited their religious beliefs as primary motivation. 

Now why is that? The answer is that we are moved by gratitude. If you are a religious person, you believe that the world didn't come into being by chance. It was god who brings about the law of nature, and other good thing that happen to us. All our ability to help people is because of the constitution of world, which is designed and continued by God; that is the religious belief. Furthermore, the religious persons would reflect that they themselves has been brought into existence by god. Your parent may have chosen to have a child, but they didn't choose you. That you came into existence is either a matter of chance, or it was the will of god. Therefore, religious people are moved by great gratitude, and therefore he wants to do someting good to please his creator. The obvious way to help his creator is to help his work, and therefore to love and care for his other chidren. [...] Of courses there are some atheists who care, but the way we are made...

Religious people also have the hope of haven. Haven is not a reward so much for good work, but home for good people. Everytime people do a good deed, it becomes easier to do one next time. God offers people the prospect of going on doing good deed, for that's what haven is about. That prospect too encourages people, the prospect that they will be able to make themselves the sort of people who are worth keeping alive forever in the presence of their creator. It is an enourmous stimulus. 

For these reasons, religion is bound to make society thrive under difficult circumstances and easier circumstances. 

(Science part omitted)

(in conclusion) so yes of courses, we need religion to thrive, even if it sometimes makes a mess of things, as atheism sometimes makes a mess of things.
